django-curvefit -- A curve fit web app.
=======================================
 
This Django app provides a web-based interface for fitting data to non-linear 
models, a common task in many scientific fields.

Seven models are currently supported; however, adding new models is trivial, 
so the application can be quickly adapted to meet individual needs.
